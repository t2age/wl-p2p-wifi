# Tutorial 2 - P2P WiFi Groups w/ Automatic IP Address  
  
Following tutorial was done with Raspbian 10 Buster and hostapd 2.7  
  
Steps A2.1.x and A2.2.x are EXACT THE SAME AS THE TUTORIAL 1!  
  
Step B2.3.x add the new instructions (Install DNSMASQ).  
  
  
**Recommendation:**  
  
DO NOT use your main system disk (sdCard), instead, use a fresh system  
or some "learn/lab/test" system to makes theses tutorials/experiments.  
After completing all set of 3 tutorials you should be able to have  
a good basic understanding of the whole matter, and should be able  
to know the best way to use the knowledge...  
  
Text Editor:  
Use the text editor of your preference, like  
Geany (GUI based) or Nano (terminal based), etc.  
  
  
  
**A2.1.0 WiFi between 2 peers (or more) w/ automatic IP Address.**  
  
  
**A2.1.1 Install hostapd software**  
  
	sudo apt install hostapd  
  
Temporarilly shutdown hostapd service  
  
	sudo service hostapd stop  
  
Unmask (unlock) hostapd service  
  
	sudo systemctl unmask hostapd.service  
	sudo systemctl enable hostapd.service  
  
  
**A2.1.2 Create/Modify hostapd configuration file (/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf)**  
  
	sudo  nano  /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf  
  
Copy and Paste the following text  
  
```
interface=wlan0  
driver=nl80211  
hw_mode=g  
channel=6  
wmm_enabled=0  
macaddr_acl=0  
auth_algs=1  
ignore_broadcast_ssid=0  
wpa=2  
wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK  
wpa_pairwise=TKIP  
rsn_pairwise=CCMP  
ssid=YOUR-SSID  
wpa_passphrase=YOUR-PASSPHRASE-PASSWORD  
```
  
  
  
**A2.1.3 Edit the file /etc/default/hostapd, modify the variable "DAEMON_CONF".**  
  
Find the line with "#DAEMON_CONF=",   
Remove any "#" sign at the beginning of the line, if it exist.  
add the following value:  
  
```
DAEMON_CONF="/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf"  
```
  
  
  
**A2.1.4 Edit the file /etc/dhcpcd.conf, give the WIFI an static IP Address**  
  
  
	sudo  nano  /etc/dhcpcd.conf  
  
Add the following lines at the end of the file.  
  
```
interface wlan0  
static ip_address=192.168.50.1/24  
nohook wpa_supplicant  
```
  
  
  
**A2.1.5 Start/Restart hostapd service**  
  
  
	sudo service hostapd start  
  
  
  
**A2.1.6 Reboot the system**  
  
  
Reboot the system, so that you can use the installed software.   
  
  
  

**A2.2.0 Add Internet Routing to the peers.**  

  
  
**A2.2.1 Edit /etc/sysctl.conf, allow IPv4 FORWARD**  
  
  
Find the line "#net.ipv4.ip_forward=1", then, remove the sharp (#) signal,  
at the start of the line. The sharp (#) signal means that this instruction  
is not active, the computer does not read lines starting with sharp (#)...  
  
The line then becomes:  
  
	net.ipv4.ip_forward=1  
  
This step will require a reboot.  
This step will require a reboot.  
The next time the system start it will be able to route traffic (forward)  
between peers and the Internet.  
  
  
  
**A2.2.2 Run the following iptables command line instructions**  
  
  
	sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE  
	sudo iptables -A FORWARD -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT  
	sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i wlan0 -o eth0 -j ACCEPT  
	  
Change the "eth0" and "wlan0" and use the names of your actual interfaces.  
Use the command "ip a" to display the actual names of your interfaces.  
  
Every time the computer REBOOT, you will need to run these lines!  
  
  
  

**B2.3.0 Install DNSMASQ (DNS Forwarder and DHCP Server)**  
  
  
  
**B2.3.1 Install dnsmasq software**  
  
  
	sudo  apt install dnsmasq  
  
Temporary stop dnsmasq service  
  
	sudo  service dnsmasq stop  
  
	  
  
**B2.3.2 Edit /etc/dnsmasq.conf**  
  
  
	sudo  nano /etc/dnsmasq.conf  
  
  
Add following lines at top or end  
  
  
```
interface=wlan0  
dhcp-range=192.168.50.50,192.168.50.100,255.255.255.0,24h	  
```
  
  
  
**B2.3.3 Restart/start dnsmasq service**  
  
  
	sudo  service dnsmasq start  
  
  
  
  
Congratulations,  
now you can connect peer-guests without the need of manual procedure to assign IP ADDRESS.  
  
Just choose SSID and enter password/passphrase.  
  
  
  
**About DNSMASQ**  
The software dnsmasq provides 2 basic services: DHCP Server and DNS Forwarder.  
The DHCP is the portion that gives a new IP ADDRESS for every  
new peer-guest that connects to the network.  
The DNS Forwarder provider a forward function to the your internet provider  
dns server function (just a kind of linkage).
